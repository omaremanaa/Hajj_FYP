      <p>Hajj is the annual pilgrimage to Makkah that Muslims are expected to make at least once in their lifetime (unless they are prevented from doing so by ill health or financial hardship) as it is the fifth pillar of Islam. The word Hajj is an Arabic word, meaning ‘to intend a journey’
      The act of Hajj includes visiting the Kaabah during the month of Dhul Hijjah and doing all the mandatory rites for Hajj.</p>

      <h3><b>Meaning of Umrah</b></h3>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Umrah is an Islamic pilgrimage to Makkah performed by Muslims that can be undertaken at any time of the year.

In Arabic, Umrah means ‘to visit a populated place.’ Umrah can be performed together along with Hajj and on other days as well.</p>

      <h4><b>Hajj Ifrad</b></h4>
      <p>Hajj Ifrad means isolated Hajj and this means that a person just performs Hajj but does not perform Umrah. The person who performs Hajj Ifrad is known as Mufrid. This is for the people who are living inside the boundaries of Masjid al Haram. The person will wear Ihram with the intention of performing Hajj only. This person can not perform Umrah, if he performs Umrah then he is no longer performing Hajj Ifrad.</p>

      <h4><b>Hajj Qiran</b></h4>
      <p>Hajj Qiran is also known as accompanied Hajj. It is for the people who do not live near Masjid al Haram. The person who performs this type of Hajj should wear Ihram with the intention of Umrah and Hajj, and both have to be performed in the same Ihram. One wears Ihram and then leave Ihram after Hajj and Umrah is completed. The person can not leave Ihram until both Hajj and Umrah are completed.</p>

      <h4><b>Hajj Tamattu</b></h4>
      <p>When you perform Hajj together with Umrah it becomes Hajj Tamattu. It is also known as Mutamatti meaning enjoyable Hajj. People who come from abroad to perform Hajj usually do Hajj Tamattu because it includes Umrah as well. To be noted that Umrah has to be done before Hajj days. One has to perform Hajj Tamattu in two different Ihrams, one for Umrah and one for Hajj.</p>
